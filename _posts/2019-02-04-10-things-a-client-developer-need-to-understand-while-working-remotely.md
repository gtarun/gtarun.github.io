title: 10 things a client developer need to understand while working remotely 
---

The world is now turning away from ‘9 to 5’ spring and embracing a different work culture characterised by global staffing. Clients are hiring developers from around the world, and neither developers nor the clients are limited in their scope.

Working remotely however can either be a hassle or a blessing. This depends on the level of interaction and engagement between the client and the development team. It is important to understand what your client needs.




Being mindful about a few key rules helps you in improving your professional relations, working efficiently and removing any existing barriers. One of our teammates lays down some golden rules of working remotely with a client. He tells us what a client actually expects when outsourcing a project to a remote team?

1. Quick Response?
Clients love working with a responsive team. This shows that the team is dedicated to the project and considers the product its own.

2. Better Coding?
Obviously, but here’s the trick. Your approach towards developing a product determines how good a coder you are. A developer can focus on building for the long term which usually requires some more time and thought than trying to find the fastest short term solution.

3. Better Thinking?
Think about the product from the end user’s perspective. This helps you come up with better suggestions and gives your client insights into improving the product. An unorganized thought process only adds to the complications in the development process, so think wisely.


4. Any Advice?
Clients welcome any advice related to the product. This helps them finalize the right features and functionalities. It also helps in setting realistic expectations.

5. Better communication?
Communication is the key. Your words help in understanding the problem and proposing relevant solutions. Communication barriers create the misconception that everything is going well. The client isn’t able to express her requirements and the developer is unable to gauge the expectations. This will hurt the product development cycle.

6. On time Delivery?
Timely product delivery makes every client happy. It also proves your efficiency as a developer. Delays put a question mark on your problem solving capability. If a complication is causing delay in the development process, discuss it with your client to find the best solution.

8. Write test cases?
Test cases are crucial to every product development cycle. You must test the application from a layman’s point of view. Someone without any technical knowledge should be able to use it without any problem. So it is important to give the right directions to the user.

9. Patience and Teamwork?
When working remotely it is difficult to coordinate with young startups and budding entrepreneurs. Their ideas change often. So be patient.

Write flexible and scalable code and keep everything documented. This will help you in suggesting new features and drawing consequences of any changes. Oftentimes it’s difficult to logically demonstrate client’s ideology. Communicate this to your client clearly.

You will probably work with other remote teammates. You can use collaboration tools like Asana, Jira etc. to communicate with them. This ensures that everyone is on the same page.


10. Get feedback
When the product is ready for delivery, try to spare some time to get feedback from the client and know if everything is working smoothly. If something needs to be fixed, do it as soon as possible.

Keeping in mind the above points will help you develop a strong relationship with your client and create a healthy remote working environment.
