title: My learnings in various aspects of my life
---

It is going to be a decade in a few years since I started my career. The journey was not easy and was full of twists, happiness, new experiences in personal and professional life. I will categories this post in a yearly manner. 

## First Year of Career

I joined the industry eager to learn and quickly picked up best practices in software engineering. I focused on honing my programming fundamentals and understanding team workflows.

## Second Year of Career

During my second year, I began leading small projects and collaborating closely with crossâ€‘functional teams. This experience taught me the importance of clear communication and thorough documentation.

_More yearly reflections to come._
